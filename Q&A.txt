(1) What is searchParams in next.js?
In Next.js, searchParams has two different contexts depending on whether you're working with a Client Component or a Server Component:

1. Client Components:

searchParams is a hook provided by next/navigation (import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation').
It returns a read-only version of the URLSearchParams interface, allowing you to access the current URL's query string parameters.

2. Server Components:

searchParams is not directly available as a hook.
It's passed as a prop to the page component function when using data fetching methods like getServerSideProps.
It's a plain JavaScript object containing the query string parameters.
Key Points:

Client-side access: Use the useSearchParams hook in Client Components to access and manipulate search parameters on the client-side (browser).
Server-side access: In Server Components, searchParams is a prop received from the data fetching method. You can use it to access query string parameters during server-side rendering.
Dynamic API: searchParams is considered a Dynamic API because its values cannot be known in advance during static rendering. This means pages that use searchParams might require additional processing on the server or client.
Here's a table summarizing the differences:

Context	Access Method	Type
Client Components	useSearchParams hook	Read-only URLSearchParams interface
Server Components (pre-rendering)	Passed as a prop to the page component function	Plain JavaScript object

Additional Considerations:

In Next.js versions before 13.4, useSearchParams might return null for compatibility reasons during migrations.
For manipulating query strings in Next.js applications, consider using the useRouter hook provided by next/router.
